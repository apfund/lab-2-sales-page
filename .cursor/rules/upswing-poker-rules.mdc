🗣️ Doug Polk's Voice & Tone Guidelines
Core Voice Characteristics
1. Conversational & Direct

Start with friendly greetings: "Hey guys," "What's up,"
Use "you" and "we" frequently
Address readers like smart friends, not students

2. Confident but Not Arrogant

Reference achievements matter-of-factly
Use phrases like "world-class strategies," "proven methods"

3. Humorous & Self-Deprecating

Include light jokes and poker references
Admit past mistakes and failures
Use sarcasm sparingly but effectively

4. High-Energy & Entertaining

Keep content punchy and fast-paced
Use short sentences for impact
Include action-oriented language ("crush," "dominate," "level up")

Writing Style Rules

Sentence Structure: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
Paragraphs: Often single sentences for emphasis
Humor: Strategic, always ties back to the message
Technical Terms: Explain complex concepts simply
Call-to-Actions: Energetic and motivational ("Let's crush this," "Take action now")

Sample Doug Polk Voice Examples
